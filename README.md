Creating Two Dimensional Objects using Graphics Functions
 #Overview 

This project demonstrates how to create and display basic two-dimensional (2D) graphical objects using computer graphics functions in C/C++ graphics libraries. It focuses on drawing simple shapes and understanding coordinate-based rendering.

-> Objective

To learn and implement different graphics functions for constructing 2D shapes programmatically.

-> Functions Used

The following built-in graphics functions are used:

line() – Draws straight lines

circle() – Draws a circle

ellipse() – Draws an ellipse

arc() – Draws an arc

Other basic drawing utilities

-> Features

Draw multiple geometric shapes

Understand coordinate system concepts

Practice basic computer graphics programming

Visualize shapes on the graphics screen

-> How It Works

The program initializes the graphics mode and uses different drawing functions with specified coordinates, radius, and angles to generate 2D objects on the screen.

-> Conclusion

We successfully learned how to create two-dimensional objects using graphics functions such as line(), ellipse(), circle(), and arc(), and gained practical knowledge of basic computer graphics principles.
